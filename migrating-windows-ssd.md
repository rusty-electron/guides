### Migrating the Windows OS to another SSD

This summer I bought an 256GB SSD to upgrade from my previous 128 GB C drive partition. I wanted to transfer my Windows partition to the new SSD so I started looking for guides. In the beginning, I had a hard time finding good guides and software recommendations but later I was able to 'mix-and-match' steps from various forums and articles, and finally complete the os migration to the SSD.
I put together this guides to save others' time that will be spent in doing the same things that I did.
